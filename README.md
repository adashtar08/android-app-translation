## App menu translation
We want to offer Avocards and help people learn with their native language. Thanks, for considering helping us.

Before you start, please make sure to check the followinng points:

- The translation will be from English to your language.
- You can propose a full translation or just a few fixes for an existing language.
- We will only add languages that are listed above for now as the content already exist for these languages and it would be too much work to add a new language.
- Try to translate using a similar text length as the original sentence when possible so it would fit the UI better.
- It would be easier for us if you could send a single modification with all of your changes rather than several small modifications. 
- Please be native of fluent in the language you plan on helping us with. We think that no translation is better than a bad translation and that is why we decided to not use automated-translation tools for the app menus.
- Check this list of pull request to see if anyone already proposed a translation of you language.
If a pull request already exists. You are more than welcome to review and comment it with improvments.
